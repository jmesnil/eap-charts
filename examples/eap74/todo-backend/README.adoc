[abstract]
The `todo-backend` quickstart demonstrates how to implement a backend that exposes a HTTP API with JAX-RS
to manage a list of ToDo which are persisted in a database with JPA.

This quickstart shows how to setup a local deployment of this backend as well as a deployment on OpenShift to connect to a PostgreSQL database also hosted on OpenShift.

The `todo-backend-s2i.yaml` chart builds and deploys the backend using EAP 7.4 S2I Builder and Runtime images
